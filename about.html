                    Hello Everyone,
                    <br><br>
                    I am Hamiz Elahi, and it gives me immense pleasure to introduce myself as the very first Vice President of School of India's very own Tech Club. I am a student of Class 9 and look forward to working with all my enthusiastic and innovative team members to have a wonderful year ahead. I would like to thank all my teachers for giving me this wonderful opportunity to be a part of this club. Technology has always been more than a passion for me — it has been a way of life.
                    <br><br>
                    I have been involved in technology ever since kindergarten, when my father taught me how to use basic software like MS Word, Notepad, and Paint. When he noticed my enthusiasm towards technology, he started teaching me how to code, and I wrote my very first Python program in 3rd grade.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then, I have learned a lot, including Python, HTML, CSS, Scratch, Arduino, and much more. I also have experience in robotics and have created projects such as a Wi-Fi controlled robot car and a line follower robot. In addition, I have gained experience in editing using different software like Adobe Photoshop, OpenShot, Krita, Kinemaster, and more. School of India has played a very important role in this journey of mine, and I am very grateful for the same.
                    <br><br>
                    This is your Tech Club Vice President signing off.
                    <br><br>
                    Warm Regards,<br>
                    Hamiz Elahi

                    Hi!<br>
                    I'm Anureet, the secretary of our school's tech club. I've always been fascinated by how technology can turn ideas into reality, whether it's through coding, robotics, AI, or animation. As secretary, I try contributing to the team by getting innovative ideas, do all the formal stuff, and support the team in making sure our projects stay on track. I believe that technology isn't just about machines, it's about creativity, collaboration, and solving real problems in fun and innovative ways. I love contributing to a space where everyone feels encouraged to experiment, learn, and share ideas freely. I'd describe myself as chill, curious, and always ready to crack a joke, even when the Wi-Fi betrays us. One quote I really connect with is: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." Through this club, I hope to help build a future where technology is not just smart, but meaningful.
